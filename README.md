## Introduction to Recommender system

> Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).

For example, if you’ve recently purchased a book on Machine Learning in Python and you’ve enjoyed reading it, it’s very likely that you’ll also enjoy reading a book on Data Visualization.People also tend to have similar tastes to those of the people they’re close to in their lives. Recommender systems try to capture these patterns and similar behaviors, to help predict what else you might like. As a proof of the importance of recommender systems, we can mention that, a few years ago, Netflix organised a challenges (the “Netflix prize”) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.
